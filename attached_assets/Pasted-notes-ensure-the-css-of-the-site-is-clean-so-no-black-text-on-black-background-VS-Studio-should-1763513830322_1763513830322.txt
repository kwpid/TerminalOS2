notes:
ensure the css of the site is clean (so no black text on black background)
VS Studio should be similair to the actual VS Code

so i should have a dashboard, and see options to create file, create folder, and import existing folder

Create a fully-featured desktop simulator in the browser from scratch. The simulation must support the Fluxo language (terminal scripting), preinstalled apps, and a fully interactive OS-like experience.

1️⃣ UI & Layout

Dark Mode Theme only

Taskbar at the bottom

Includes a Start Menu / Popup Button

Start Menu lists installed apps

Supports right-click on taskbar icons for Close and Properties

Desktop Area

Supports desktop icons for apps and files

Background image or color

Drag-and-drop icons

Windows

Draggable, resizable, minimizable, closable

Smooth movement animations

Each window has basic properties:

Window ID

Uptime

Status (open, closed, minimized)

Position (x, y)

Size (width, height)

Right-click → Close, Properties

Properties window can show advanced info:

libary, ui, components paths

Player can query these via Fluxo commands

Fluxo scripts can read/write these paths

2️⃣ Apps

Preinstalled apps:

Terminal

Full Fluxo language support

Can read/write system data

Can control windows and workspace via Fluxo

VS.Studio

Simplified Visual Studio Code experience

File explorer, tabs, editor

Full Fluxo syntax support

Syntax highlighting, autocomplete, error detection, export/import modules

Files

Simulate computer files/folders

Stores app files, user files, Fluxo scripts

Drag-and-drop functionality

Right-click → open, properties

Web Browser

Minimal browsing simulation

Can load local or predefined pages

Web Store

Allows installing additional apps

New apps appear on desktop and in Start Menu

3️⃣ Fluxo Integration

Every window/app object is exposed to Fluxo:

local app = window(win-3)
app.move:(x, y)
app.resize:(width, height)
app.close:()
app.focus:()


Fluxo scripts can access desktop paths (libary, ui, components)

Modules can be required via Fluxo:

require("modules/windowTools")


Fluxo scripts can read/write window properties and system data

Advanced properties are hidden unless queried in Fluxo

4️⃣ Window & Taskbar Behavior

Dragging windows with smooth animation

Taskbar shows open windows, clicking brings to front

Right-click menu on taskbar icon: Close, Properties

Properties window shows basic + advanced info

Background/desktop icons also have right-click menus (Open, Properties)

5️⃣ System Structure

Desktop Object Model:

desktop.icons → all desktop icons

desktop.background → background image/color

windows → all open windows

installedApps → all apps in system

Window Object:

id, title, x, y, width, height, status, uptime, focused

Methods:

move:(x,y)

resize:(w,h)

close:()

minimize:()

focus:()

6️⃣ File System Simulation

Files and folders represented in a tree structure

Fluxo scripts can navigate and modify files

Apps have dedicated folders in the system

Preloaded files for apps to simulate a working computer environment

7️⃣ Modules & Fluxo Support

Modules can be declared:

module windowTools {
  export function moveWindow(win, x, y) {
    win.move:(x, y)
  }
}


Scripts can require("[filename/directory]") to import module functions

Workspace must support Fluxo script execution inside Terminal and VS.Studio

Module variables and functions must be accessible to other scripts after require

8️⃣ Interaction & Gameplay / Simulation Features

Player can drag desktop icons and windows

Player can open/close/minimize windows

Player can execute Fluxo commands in the terminal

Player can explore system paths, simulate hacking or automation

Installed apps show in Start Menu and can be opened multiple times

9️⃣ Technical Requirements

Frontend Only (no backend required)

Languages: HTML, CSS, JS

Libraries: optional for smooth window dragging, e.g., interact.js or pure JS

Use Monaco Editor for VS.Studio code editor

Smooth window transitions, scalable window stacking

Maintain workspace state (windows, open apps, Fluxo environment, files)

10️⃣ Starter Setup / Files

Preinstall:

Terminal.fxo → Fluxo terminal

VS.Studio.fxo → Fluxo code workspace

Files.fxo → file explorer

Browser.fxo → web browser

WebStore.fxo → app installer

Default desktop icons for each preinstalled app

Sample Fluxo scripts in VS.Studio workspace for testing

Goal

Create a fully-functional browser desktop simulator where the player can:

Drag, open, close, and manage windows

Open apps from taskbar or desktop icons

Access and run Fluxo scripts

Explore system paths and manipulate window properties

Interact with a simulated computer environment realistically
